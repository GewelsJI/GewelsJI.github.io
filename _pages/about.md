About Me
======
I joined the College of Engineering and Computer Science, Australian National University as a Ph.D. student in 2022 fall, under the supervision of [Prof. Nick Barnes](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yMXs1WcAAAAJ&hl=en), and also, fortunately, received academic instructions from [Dr. Deng-Ping Fan](https://dengpingfan.github.io/). Before that, I received my Master's degree from the School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, in 2021.

Research Interests
======
My primary research interest lies in solving challenging problems in computer vision and machine learning. Especially in designing effective and scalable algorithms for dense prediction problems in the real world, including:
- **Complex Scene Understanding:** camouflaged/salient object discovery on different data modalities (e.g., RGB, RGB-Depth, RGB-Thermal, Light-Field)
- **Automated Driving:** video object segmentation, open-world scene understanding
- **Medical Image Analysis:** colonoscopy polyp diagnosis, lung infection segmentation


Recent Updates
======
- [18/10/2022] Our paper about video object segmentation is published by Computational Visual Media Journal (CVMJ). ([Open Access](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41095-021-0262-4))
- [14/10/2022] One paper about vision-language representation was accepted by Machine Intelligence Research (MIR) journal.
- [24/08/2022] One paper about video polyp segmentation was accepted by Machine Intelligence Research (MIR) journal.
- [06/08/2022] One paper about efficient camouflaged object detection was accepted by Machine Intelligence Research (MIR) journal.
