I joined the College of Engineering and Computer Science, Australian National University as a Ph.D. student in 2022 fall, under the supervision of [Prof. Nick Barnes](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yMXs1WcAAAAJ&hl=en), and also fortunately received academic instructions from [Dr. Deng-Ping Fan](https://dengpingfan.github.io/). Before that, I received my Master's degree from the School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, in 2021.


Research Interests
======
My primary research interest lies in solving challenging problems in computer vision and machine learning. Especially on designing effective and scalable algorithms for resolving dense prediction problems in the real world, including **complex scene understanding** (*e.g.*, camouflaged/salient object discovery), **automated driving** (*e.g.*, open-world image/video scene understanding) and **healthcare AI** (*e.g.*, polyp segmentation, lung infection segmentation) problems.
