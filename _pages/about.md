I join the Australian National University as a Ph.D. student in 2022 fall, under the supervision of [Prof. Nick Barnes](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yMXs1WcAAAAJ&hl=en), and also fortunately received academic instructions from [Dr. Deng-Ping Fan](https://dengpingfan.github.io/). Before that, I received my Master's degree from the School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, in 2021.


Research Interests
======
My primary research interest lies in designing effective and applicable AI algorithms for resolving dense prediction problems in the real world. Especially on these complex scene understanding (*e.g.*, camouflaged/salient object discovery), automated driving (*e.g.*, open-world image/video scene understanding) and healthcare (*e.g.*, polyp segmentation, lung infection segmentation) problems.

Recent Updates
======
- [24/08/2022] One paper about video polyp segmentation was accepted by Machine Intelligence Research (MIR) journal.
- [06/08/2022] One paper about efficient camouflaged object detection was accepted by Machine Intelligence Research (MIR) journal.
