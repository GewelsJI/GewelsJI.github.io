I join the Australian National University as a Ph.D. student in 2022 fall, under the supervision of [Prof. Nick Barnes](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yMXs1WcAAAAJ&hl=en). Before that, I received academic guidance from external research advisor, [Dr. Deng-Ping Fan](https://dengpingfan.github.io/) during 2018-2022. 

Research Interests
======
My primary research interest lies in working on fancy applications in computer vision, medical image analysis, and video content understanding, especially on how to design an effective and applicable algorithms to resolve the dense prediction problems in the real world.

Updates
======
- *[24/August/2022]* :bangbang: We present a new task, video polyp segmentation (VPS), which has been accepted by [Machine Intelligence Research (MIR)](https://www.springer.com/journal/11633). We release the first large-scale VPS dataset, termed **SUN-SEG**, containing 158,690 frames with densely-annotated labels. These labels can further support the development of medical colonoscopy diagnosis, localization, and their derivative tasks. For more details, please refer to our [project page](https://github.com/GewelsJI/VPS) / [technical report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.14291v3.pdf).

- *[06/August/2022]* :heavy_exclamation_mark: Our paper about camouflaged object detection (COD) has been accepted by [Machine Intelligence Research (MIR)](https://www.springer.com/journal/11633) journal. This is a simple but efficient baseline, **DGNet**, with a novel object gradient supervision for the COD task. Additionally, we construct a comprehensive COD benchmark with 20 competed approaches. Read our [technical report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.12853.pdf) for more details. We also implement our model via [Jittor](https://github.com/GewelsJI/DGNet/tree/main/jittor_lib) & [PyTorch](https://github.com/GewelsJI/DGNet/tree/main/pytorch_lib) toolboxes.
